This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook designed to provide an overview of various graph types, their characteristics, and appropriate use cases. It serves as a practical reference for understanding different visualizations and when to use them in data analysis and presentation.

Contents
The notebook covers the following graph types:

Bar Chart: Useful for comparing quantities across categories.
Line Chart: Ideal for showing trends over time or continuous data.
Pie Chart: Represents proportions within a whole.
Histogram: Visualizes the distribution of a single variable.
Scatter Plot: Shows relationships between two numerical variables.
Box Plot: Displays the distribution, central tendency, and variability of data.
Heatmap: Useful for visualizing matrix-like data with color gradients.
Each section includes:

A brief description of the graph type and its common use cases.
Example code, using Python libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn.
Visual output to illustrate how the graph appears.# Graph-Type-Notebook
